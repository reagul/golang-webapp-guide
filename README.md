# Golang WebApp Guide

A simple guide on golang web app development.

It starts with the very basics and slowly adds more functionality, sticking mainly with the standard golang packages, although a few external packages are used here and there. The main reason being to be more educational and not to black box things.

Each part is separated into it's own section, in the hopes of making it simpler to understand and grasp that particular section. Various sections do rely upon previous ones and but hopefully won't be terribly confusing.
